# Code Review Guidelines

## Objectives of Code Review
- **Ensure Code Quality**: Check for readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.
- **Verify Functionality**: Ensure the code works as intended and meets the requirements.
- **Prevent Issues**: Identify potential bugs, edge cases, and performance bottlenecks.
- **Establish Best Practices**: Promote standardized development practices across the team.

## Code Review Checklist

### **1. Code Quality**
- Is the code **readable** and easy for others to understand?
- Does it follow the defined **ESLint coding standards** (e.g., indentation, formatting, naming conventions)?
  - Run the `eslint` tool to catch linting issues:
    ```bash
    npx eslint .
    ```
  - Ensure no linting errors exist or that issues are justified with appropriate comments.
  - Look for areas where the rules might help optimize the code or catch issues (e.g., `no-unused-vars`, `no-undef` errors).

- Are variable names, function names, and overall structure **descriptive and logical**?
- Does the code avoid unnecessary complexity and redundancy?

---

### **2. Functionality**
- Does the code **meet the requirements** of the task or feature it is meant to address?
- Has the developer considered **edge cases** and potential scenarios where the code might fail?
- Are all the necessary inputs/outputs, error handling, and validations implemented?

---

### **3. Testing**
- **Jest Tests:**
  - Does the code include adequate **unit tests** or **integration tests** written with Jest?
  - Are the tests written for all critical paths, edge cases, and expected behaviors?
  - Verify that tests are recognized and pass without errors using:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
  - Are there meaningful and descriptive test names for clarity?
    For example:
    ```javascript
    test('should return 42 when given inputs 40 and 2', () => {
      expect(add(40, 2)).toBe(42);
    });
    ```

- Does adding the code negatively impact current tests? Ensure no regressions.
  - Check the output to verify all test suites pass:
    ```
    PASS tests/specificTestSuite.test.js
    PASS tests/anotherSuite.test.js
    ```

---

### **4. Optimization**
- Is the code **free of redundancy**, unused imports, and dead code?
- Are there any **obvious performance optimizations**?
  - For example, use `map()` instead of `for` loops for better readability, or leverage caching for expensive operations.
- Are third-party libraries used appropriately, or can they be replaced with simpler, native alternatives?
- Check ESLint rules related to optimization:
  - `no-unused-vars`, `no-console`, `prefer-const`, etc., with strict ESLint configurations.

---

### **5. Documentation**
- Is the code **self-documenting**, with meaningful variable and function names?
- Are all major functions, classes, APIs, and key components **documented** with comments?
- If applicable, has the **README** or other relevant documentation been updated to reflect changes?
- Verify that the purpose of the changes is easy to understand for other developers.

## How to Use ESLint and Jest During Code Review

### **Using ESLint**
1. Ensure ESLint is properly configured for the project. Check the existence of an `.eslintrc.json` or `.eslintrc.js` file.
2. Run ESLint across the codebase:
   ```bash
   npx eslint .
Fix minor lint issues automatically using:
bash
npx eslint . --fix
Review any remaining ESLint warnings or errors and ensure they’re addressed.
Look for:
Proper formatting, consistent indentation, and spacing.
No unused variables (no-unused-vars).
Proper import/export usage (no-undef or import/order).
Using Jest
Run the Jest test suite to ensure all tests pass:
bash
npm test
Review test cases for:
Coverage: Ensure that critical paths, edge cases, and expected behaviors have sufficient tests.
Accuracy: Verify that test assertions are meaningful and relevant.
Structure: Ensure test files are logically grouped and well-organized (e.g., files ending in .test.js).
Check for regressions. If new code breaks existing tests, raise this as part of the review.
Code Review Process
Clone and Test Code: Clone the branch locally and check that it:
Builds/runs without errors.
Passes all tests using Jest.
Passes lint checks using ESLint.
Analyze Against the Checklist: Review the code using the checklist above.
Provide Feedback:
Be constructive and specific. Use examples where appropriate.
For example, instead of saying: “This is bad”, say: “Consider using a forEach() loop instead of map() here, as the return value isn’t used.”
Approve the Pull Request: Approve it only after all necessary changes have been addressed and test cases pass.
